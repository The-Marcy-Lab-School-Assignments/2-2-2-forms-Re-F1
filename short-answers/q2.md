# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
Labels are necessary for the input as they provide a way to link an assistive accessiblity, for example : an aria-label would accesss the labels of the input to read the text content to the user and what the label reads. The for attribute in the `label` element should match the id of the corresponding `input` element.

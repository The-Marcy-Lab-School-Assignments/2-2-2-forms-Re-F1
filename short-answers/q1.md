# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
The email and password is being displayed and the page refreshes. The password is included in the URL as plain text : (?***email=tom***%40***gmail.com***&**password**=**123456**). Adding a `event.preventdefault()` will allow the page to not be refreshed every time the submit button is made.

While this is true, it's important to note that the default behavior of a form submission is to reload the page.

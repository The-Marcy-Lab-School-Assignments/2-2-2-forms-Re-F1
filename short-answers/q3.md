# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?


# Answer
>Default submit behavior: ``button type="submit"` submit the form they are contained within when clicked

>Reset behavior: `button type="reset"` resets the form fields to their initial values when it is clicked

>No default behavior: `button type="button"` does nothing, but can do something if attached to a js file
